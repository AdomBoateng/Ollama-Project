# Ollama Project

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the integration of Ollama with LangChain and LlamaIndex to build advanced AI applications. Ollama is a framework designed to streamline the development and deployment of language models, making it easier to manage and fine-tune models for various tasks. By leveraging Ollama, we can create powerful AI systems that are both scalable and efficient.

## What is Ollama?

Ollama is a Python-based framework that simplifies the process of working with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for managing, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs, making it an ideal choice for AI and machine learning projects. Ollama integrates seamlessly with popular libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex, allowing developers to create complex AI workflows with minimal effort.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **Ollama with LangChain**:  
   This project showcases how to integrate Ollama with LangChain to build dynamic AI-driven applications. LangChain provides a robust framework for managing conversational AI workflows, and Ollama enhances its capabilities by providing seamless model management.

2. **Ollama with LlamaIndex**:  
   This project demonstrates the integration of Ollama with LlamaIndex, a powerful tool for creating and managing large indexes for language models. By combining Ollama's model management with LlamaIndex's indexing capabilities, we can efficiently handle large datasets and build scalable AI systems.

## Requirements
